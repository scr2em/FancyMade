    "fqa_a1":"Return policies are the rules a retailer creates to manage how customers return and exchange unwanted merchandise they purchased. A return policy tells customers what items can be returned and for what reasons, and the timeframe over which returns are accepted.    Why have a return policy? Getting a return request can be painful both financially and emotionally. Refunding a customer’s order can result in a loss of profitability, and knowing that someone disliked your product can be disheartening for business owners who strongly believe in the benefits of what they sell. For these reasons, it can be tempting to ignore the reality of returns and exchanges and leave the mounting problem unaddressed.",
    "fqa_a2":"If you’re running an ecommerce business, you’ll want to put a return merchandise authorization system (RMA) in place to manage returns in your store. Having an easy returns process can take the pain out of returns and exchanges for both the business and its customers. Whether you’re receiving your first return request or are trying to repair a flawed returns process, your RMA system can immediately help cut down the customer service hours spent on returns and exchanges.",
